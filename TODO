TODO list:

TODO List will be added to over time
TODO Completed tasks will have an 'X' before their number

1: Endless track generation - likely requires an engine for testing if the track is possible, can simply use text for map-making
**Note** use list of premade tracks and randomise the order

2: Multiplayer capability - split screen, points awarded to player for finishing track seconds before other player - next track loading waits for both players to finish - start with 2 players on the same device, then possibly expand to IP/Port based multiplayer

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
3: Buttons on title screen to switch from easy/medium/hard mode without using system arg variables - possibly add a fullscreen button with it

X  3: Buttons on title screen to switch from easy/medium/hard mode without using system arg variables - possibly add a fullscreen button with it (now possibly resize them)

4: Press the 'V' button or some other key to speed up time by 50% - note: is difficult due to circular imports
