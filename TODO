TODO list:

TODO List will be added to over time
TODO Completed tasks will have an 'X' before their number

1: Endless track generation - likely requires an engine for testing if the track is possible, can simply use text for map-making
**Note** use list of premade tracks and randomise the order

2: Multiplayer capability - split screen, points awarded to player for finishing track seconds before other player - next track loading waits for both players to finish

3: Buttons on title screen to switch from easy/medium/hard mode without using system arg variables
